I used to work for hours without distractions, but now, constant digital interruptions and doom-scrolling had eroded my concentration.\rIt became difficult to even sit through a 20-minute video, let alone focus on tasks. Despite attempts like caffeine, quiet spaces, and packed schedules, nothing seemed to help. In Gen Z terms, I had fallen victim to social media brain rot. 🧠📱\nMajor Concern\rThis isn’t just my problem—it's a widespread issue. Research shows that **50%** of people feel their attention span has significantly decreased. After a deep dive into *YouTube* and *Google*, I found countless people sharing similar struggles, alongside potential solutions. 🚨\rHow I’m Fixing It 🛠️\r### 1. Embrace the Boredom 🫥\rIt’s time to **get comfy with being bored**. The moment you reach for your phone is when you’re actually *bored*. Try doing stuff without distractions—like eating without scrolling through your phone or showering without music. It's annoying at first, but trust me, it works.\r2. Be Intentional with What You Watch 🎥\rI love watching videos while I eat. But instead of mindlessly watching shorts or quick YouTube clips, I now force myself to watch something longer and more meaningful. It’s like training your brain to focus again.\n3. The Pomodoro Technique ⏲️\rWhen I need to grind through work, I use the Pomodoro Technique. It’s all about working in focused bursts with timed breaks in between. If you haven’t tried it, you can learn more about it here\r.\nHere are a couple of timers I’ve been using:\nAesthetic Pomodoro Timer\rPomodoro Chrome Extension\r4. Detox from Social Media 🚫\rThis one is hard, but cutting down on social media is essential. You don’t have to do it all at once. Just start by spending more time hanging out with friends, joining clubs, or studying with people. You’ll feel tired, but also clear-minded.\n5. Study with Strangers 👥\rIf you need a little extra push, there are these study-with-strangers online groups where you can study alongside others in real time:\nStudy Together\rStudyStream\r6. Adventure Studying 🌍\rSometimes a change of scenery can help. I call it adventure studying—whether it’s a café, a park, or somewhere you’ve never studied before. For me, IHOP has become a favorite spot. Try finding a place you like and shake up your routine.\nDisclaimer: I'm not sponsored by or affiliated with any of the websites, apps, or tools I mentioned. Be sure to do your own research before using any of them to make sure they suit your needs.\rConclusion\rRemember, **it's not a sprint; it's a marathon**. Recovery takes time, but the more you practice being mindful, the stronger your focus will get. Whether you're just starting or already deep into the process, progress is progress. 💪\r","date":"2024-09-08","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/recovering_attention_span/","summary":"\rRealizing the Problem\rReturning to grad school after being a working professional for a year, I quickly realized how much my ability to focus had deteriorated.

But with some determination, teamwork, and a little bit of luck, my team and I managed not just to participate—but actually win!\nThe Journey Begins\rIt was around 6 PM when I got a message saying it was going to snow that night. I quickly packed up my hoodie, grabbed my favorite keyboard, and headed out with my friend. Just like me, my teammates hadn\u0026rsquo;t done a hackathon before either, and none of us came from a computer science background, so we were already at a bit of a disadvantage.\nWhen I got into the car, my friend casually mentioned, “Let’s just have a good time.” I couldn’t help but respond, “Well, if I’m doing this, I’m aiming to win.” It was one of those moments where you say something without fully knowing how it will turn out. He just laughed, not taking it too seriously.\nForming the Team\rWhen the hackathon kicked off, while the other teams were diving into their projects, we were still trying to figure out what to build. But we had one advantage: we were all grad students. I had some app development experience, so I suggested we use Flutter. The first few hours were spent watching tutorials just to get it installed. My friend and I also procrastinated a bit—we still had homework to do—so it wasn’t an easy start. It’s funny looking back now, but there was definitely some tension in the air.\nBuilding the Project: Echoes of Equality\rWith my background in app development, I took charge of setting up the architecture and showing everyone what was possible with Flutter. As we started implementing features, we all began to feel a bit more confident.\nThe Night Struggles\rAs the night went on, we hit a snag. We needed to use Firebase, which is usually a breeze for me, but that night, it just wasn’t working. I wasted hours on it and couldn’t get it to work. Just when I was about to take a nap out of frustration, my friend managed to pull it off. It was a huge relief. But then, of course, we got greedy and decided to add more and more features.\nThe Final Push\rI could go on and on about the rest of the hackathon, but the bottom line is, we weren’t sure how it would turn out until the very end. But when we presented our app, everyone loved it. They were so impressed, they said they wanted to use it in their daily lives right away. In the end, we won both the Beginner Category and the LGBTQIA+ Category.\nReflections\rIt’s a bit of a drag that we couldn’t take the app any further, but we received a lot of appreciation from all over the CS department, including the Head of the Department. The organizer even mentioned us in a LinkedIn post! You can check it out here\r.\nIf you’re curious to learn more about \u0026ldquo;Echoes of Equality,\u0026rdquo; you can check out the project on DevPost\r.\nGallery\rHere\u0026rsquo;s a collection of images that capture the spirit of the hackathon:\n","date":"2024-09-02","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/hackathon/","summary":"Participating in my first-ever hackathon was a wild ride.\n","title":"My First Ever Hackathon Experience: Spoiler Alert - I Won!","type":"posts"},{"content":" Moving from Golden Rock in India to Golden, Colorado, has been a journey filled with cultural contrasts and unexpected surprises...\rTap Water: The First Scary Sip\rBack home in India, tap water is something you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dream of drinking without boiling or filtering first. But here in the US, everyone drinks straight from the tap! At first, I hesitated and stared at the glass, wondering if this was a good idea. But soon, I got used to it, and now, I love the convenience (though I still miss our boiled water).\nThe Mysterious Toilet Seat Cover\rIn India, we flush and typically use a handheld hose (or bidet) to clean up—it\u0026rsquo;s quick and thorough. But here in the US, I was introduced to a completely different approach: toilet paper, wipes, and the mysterious toilet seat covers. At first, it was a bit of a puzzle to figure out how to use these covers, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a pretty neat way to keep things clean. If you’re as confused as I was, check out this video on how to set one up:\nAlso, public restrooms are super clean here, which I absolutely love.\nTipping and Taxes: Surprise at the Register\rOne of the biggest shocks was at the cash register—why is the price higher than what’s on the tag? Welcome to the world of taxes that aren’t included in the price, and don’t forget to tip! It took a while to get used to tipping 15-20% on everything, but it’s just part of the culture here.\nHonking: It’s Not What You Think\rIn India, honking is like saying, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m here!\u0026rdquo; In the US, honking is more like, \u0026ldquo;What are you doing?!\u0026rdquo; It’s less about signaling and more about expressing displeasure, which I quickly learned to avoid.\nThe Gym: Pounds and Public Nudity\rAs someone who hits the gym regularly, I quickly realized that everything here is in pounds (lbs), not kilograms. To make life easier, I created an app that helps with these conversions—check it out if you’re in the same boat:\nConverter4Me\rOh, and don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if people walk around naked in the locker rooms. It\u0026rsquo;s totally normal here. Just smile and carry on.\nDrinking: Cheers!\rDrinking is a pretty normal and socially accepted activity here. Whether it’s a casual drink after work or a weekend hangout, alcohol is a common sight.\nHolding Doors: The Unexpected Courtesy\rOne of the most charming aspects of American culture is the way people hold doors open for others. It’s such a small gesture, but it really makes your day. I’ve started doing it myself, and it’s a habit I’m happy to pick up.\nNavigating these cultural differences has been both amusing and enlightening. Moving to a new country comes with its challenges, but it’s these little quirks that make the journey worthwhile. If you’re an international student or just curious about these cultural contrasts, I hope you enjoyed this peek into my experience!\n","date":"2024-09-02","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/the-culture-shock/","summary":" Moving from Golden Rock in India to Golden, Colorado, has been a journey filled with cultural contrasts and unexpected surprises...\rTap Water: The First Scary Sip\rBack home in India, tap water is something you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dream of drinking without boiling or filtering first.

The analogy illustrates how the same object (or person) can be valued differently depending on the surroundings.\rHere's the story: - A bottle of water at Costco costs $0.25. - The same bottle in a supermarket is worth about $0.50. - At a bar, the same bottle costs $2. - In a high-end restaurant or hotel, the bottle might be priced as high as $3. - At an airport or on a plane, the bottle is sold for $5. The bottle and its contents don’t change—the only thing that varies is where it is being sold.
