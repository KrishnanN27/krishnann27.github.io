If I had to explain my research in one picture: it’s like putting a ship on top of a plane.
</p>

AI and machine learning are already fast and powerful, like a plane.
Quantum computing doesn’t replace them—it brings an entire ship on board, opening up a completely new way of representing and solving problems.
Together, they can reach destinations that classical methods alone could never access.

## What I Do

My research in **quantum computing** focuses on designing algorithms to tackle scientific problems governed by **partial differential equations (PDEs)**.
These equations describe the behavior of complex physical systems—from fluid flow in porous media to the dynamics of large-scale engineering processes—that are often too demanding for classical computers.

## Hybrid Quantum–AI

I am developing **hybrid quantum–AI methods**, with a strong emphasis on machine learning, that combine the strengths of both paradigms.
The goal is to achieve **efficiency, scalability, and accuracy** beyond what either quantum algorithms or AI techniques can deliver on their own.

## Why It Matters

By reformulating PDE-based models for quantum hardware, my goal is to simulate **multiscale, multiphysics processes** in science and engineering.
This opens the door to breakthroughs in modeling, prediction, and discovery—pushing science and engineering beyond the limits of classical approaches.
