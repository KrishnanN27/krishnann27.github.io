When I was looking for advice on getting into a research-based MS, I found plenty about PhDs but almost nothing about what a Master’s thesis actually feels like. This post is meant to fill that gap and give you a clearer picture of what the journey really looks like.

A lot of students who want hands-on research jump straight from **Bachelor’s to PhD**, while others go for a **coursework-only MS**. The **MS thesis** sits somewhere in between — not the most common route, and often misunderstood.

In this post, I want to share what I’ve learned about that middle ground — things I wish someone had explained when I was figuring it out.
I’ll talk about:

</ul>

An MS thesis might look like a “mini PhD” on paper, but it’s really its own thing — a mix of structure and self-direction that tests how well you can explore and think independently.

If you’re planning to start one or already knee-deep in it, I hope this helps you see what to expect, what to avoid, and how to make the most of the experience.

    What an MS Thesis Actually Is
  </h2>

 <p>
  Before we get into this, I'd like you to take a quick look at

     rel="noopener"
     class="link">
    The Illustrated Guide to a PhD
  </a>.
  Now, if you’ve gone through it, an MS thesis sits somewhere between those two last stages —
  deepening your specialty while giving you just enough of a push toward independent research.
</p>

<p>
  It’s a research-based MS degree where you don’t just focus on high-level coursework but also apply what you learn in practice.
  Now that I’m doing my PhD, I can honestly say my MS thesis did feel like a “mini PhD,” but I don’t want that term to scare anyone off.
  It’s a rewarding experience that gives you a taste of both worlds — coursework and research. Personally, I’m glad I took this route instead of going straight from a bachelor’s to a PhD or doing a pure coursework MS.
</p>

<p>
  I was going to save this for later sections, but it makes sense to talk about some of the <strong>good sides</strong> of doing an MS thesis — the benefits.
</p>

<p>If you successfully get into your MS thesis (I’ll call it <strong>MST</strong> from here on), here’s what you can expect:</p>

<ul style="line-height:1.8; margin:1rem 0 1.5rem 1.5rem;">
  <li>
    <strong>First</strong>, you’ll likely have a position called <strong>Research Assistant</strong> (sounds fancy, right?).
    Hopefully, and usually your advisor will be able to support you financially — meaning your tuition, insurance, and even a monthly stipend are covered.
    This can vary depending on your school and state. In some cases, you might instead get a <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> role, which still helps cover your costs.
    Either way, in most cases, you’ll find some form of support — though, like everything in grad school, there are exceptions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Second</strong>, there will be <strong>less coursework</strong>.
    I know you might question me for calling that a good thing (it is, at least for me and my peers).
    It gives you the space to dive into research without feeling overloaded by classes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Third</strong>, if you’re a <strong>working professional</strong> and just want to deepen your specialty,
    there wouldn’t be a better match than this.
    You get to focus on your field, apply it in practice, and still get a glimpse of your college days — well, at least part of it.
  </li>
</ul>

<div style="padding:10px; border-radius:6px; background-color:var(--note-bg-light); color:var(--note-color-light); margin:16px 0;">
  Doing an MS thesis isn’t just about finishing a project — it’s about learning how to think, explore, and figure things out on your own.
</div>

<p>
  So now that you have a sense of what an MST actually is, the next question is:
  <strong>how do you get into one, and what makes for a good approach?</strong>
</p>

<section id="what-a-good-approach-looks-like-for-getting-into-an-ms-thesis" style="margin-top:3rem;">

  <h2 style="font-size:1.6rem; font-weight:700; margin-bottom:1rem; border-bottom:1px solid var(--border-color,#ddd); padding-bottom:0.25rem;">
    What a Good Approach Looks Like for Getting into an MS Thesis
  </h2>

  <p>
    Okay, so let’s say you’ve decided you want to do an MST.
    Now comes the part no one really explains — <em>how do you actually get into one?</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike coursework programs where you just apply, get in, and pick classes,
    a thesis-based MS depends a lot on <strong>finding an advisor</strong> and
    <strong>aligning your interests</strong>. That part usually starts
    <em>way earlier</em> than most people think.
  </p>

  <p>Maybe we can call this <strong>Stage 0</strong> — before everything else.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size:1.25rem; margin-top:2rem; font-weight:600;">Picking a Research Interest</h3>

  <p>
    I’ve always believed the most important thing is knowing what you <strong>don’t</strong> want to do.
    I tend to think practically — what’s current, where the field’s heading, and what feels like a good, realistic bet.
    It’s not the most romantic way to pick a topic, but it worked for me.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re someone who follows curiosity more than planning, I’d recommend checking out
    <a href="https://lennartnacke.substack.com/i/149604218/follow-your-interests"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link">
      “How to Pick a Research Topic (and Actually Love It)” by Lennart Nacke, PhD
    </a>.
    It’s written for PhD students, but it applies perfectly to anyone starting research.
    Here’s the short version I liked:
  </p>

  <ul style="line-height:1.8; margin:1rem 0 1.5rem 1.5rem;">
    <li>
      <strong>Follow what actually interests you.</strong>
      Don’t pick something because it looks impressive — pick what you genuinely enjoy learning about.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Read just enough to see what’s hot.</strong>
      Don’t overthink the topic too early — it’s a momentum thing.
      Ideas won’t magically appear while you’re relaxing; they show up when you’re exploring and trying stuff.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Keep it realistic.</strong>
      Cool ideas are great, but practicality matters.
      Make sure you’ve got the time, tools, and support to actually get somewhere with it.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="font-size:1.25rem; margin-top:1rem; font-weight:600;">Finding the Right Advisor</h3>

  <p>
    Once you’ve got a direction, the next step is finding the person who’ll guide you — and that’s where things get real.
  </p>

<ul style="line-height:1.8; margin:1rem 0 1.5rem 1.5rem;">
  <li>
    <strong><a href="#start-early" class="link">Start early.</a></strong>
    Don’t wait until you’re admitted to look for professors. Browse your department’s site,
    check who’s working on topics that seem interesting, and note down potential matches.
    I explain this in more detail just below — it’s probably the most useful step to get right early.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Find alignment.</strong>
    Focus on how your goals and working style fit with theirs. Some professors are very hands-on,
    others prefer independent students — neither is better, but the fit matters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Talk to students if you can.</strong>
    They’ll tell you what the lab is actually like — how often people meet, how supportive the advisor is,
    and whether the environment matches what you’re looking for.
  </li>
</ul>

<a id="start-early"></a>

  <h3 style="font-size:1.25rem; margin-top:2rem; font-weight:600;">Start Early</h3>

  <p>
    This part tends to confuse people, but it’s simple once you break it down.
  </p>

  <ol style="line-height:1.8; margin:1rem 0 1.5rem 1.5rem;">
    <li>
      <strong>Check who’s hiring.</strong>
      Go through your department or research group pages. Most professors (especially in CS)
      have their own sites where they mention if they’re looking for MS/PhD students.
      Even if nothing’s listed, it doesn’t hurt to ask — some just don’t update their sites.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Do a bit of homework.</strong>
      Look them up on Google Scholar and skim a few of their recent papers — maybe from 2023–2025.
      You don’t have to understand everything, just get a sense of the kind of problems they’re working on.
      If you’re new to reading papers,
      <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link">
        “How to Read an Engineering Research Paper”
      </a> is a great start.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reach out properly.</strong>
      Remember, professors are going to invest their time and funding in you,
      so first impressions matter. Keep your message short, specific, and personal.
      Here’s a clean version of what I used:
    </li>
  </ol>

      <strong>Be ready to talk.</strong>
      If they’re interested, you might get a short meeting or chat.
      You don’t have to “pitch” yourself — just be genuine and prepared for a few questions like:
      <ul>
        <li>Why this professor or lab?</li>
        <li>Why a thesis instead of coursework-only?</li>
        <li>What kind of problems do you like working on?</li>
        <li>Would you consider a PhD later? (It’s fine to say yes — it shows openness.)</li>
      </ul>
      Think of it like a normal conversation, not an interview.
