## Realizing the Problem

<div style="padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); color: var(--primary-color);">
Returning to grad school after being a working professional for a year, I quickly realized how much my ability to focus had deteriorated. I used to work for hours without distractions, but now, constant digital interruptions and doom-scrolling had eroded my concentration.

It became difficult to even sit through a 20-minute video, let alone focus on tasks. Despite attempts like **caffeine**, quiet spaces, and packed schedules, nothing seemed to help. In _Gen Z_ terms, I had fallen victim to **social media brain rot**. 🧠📱

## Major Concern

<div style="padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); color: var(--primary-color);">
This isn’t just my problem—it's a widespread issue. Research shows that **50%** of people feel their attention span has significantly decreased. After a deep dive into *YouTube* and *Google*, I found countless people sharing similar struggles, alongside potential solutions. 🚨

## How I’m Fixing It 🛠️

<div style="padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); color: var(--primary-color);">
### 1. Embrace the Boredom 🫥
It’s time to **get comfy with being bored**. The moment you reach for your phone is when you’re actually *bored*. Try doing stuff without distractions—like eating without scrolling through your phone or showering without music. It's annoying at first, but trust me, it works.

### 2. Be Intentional with What You Watch 🎥

I love watching videos while I eat. But instead of mindlessly watching **shorts** or **quick YouTube clips**, I now **force myself** to watch something longer and more meaningful. It’s like training your brain to _focus_ again.

### 3. The Pomodoro Technique ⏲️

When I need to grind through work, I use the **Pomodoro Technique**. It’s all about working in focused bursts with timed breaks in between. If you haven’t tried it, you can learn more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

Here are a couple of timers I’ve been using:

- [Aesthetic Pomodoro Timer](https://studywithme.io/aesthetic-pomodoro-timer/)
- [Pomodoro Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pomodoro-chrome-extension/iccjkhpkdhdhjiaocipcegfeoclioejn)

### 4. Detox from Social Media 🚫

This one is hard, but cutting down on social media is essential. You don’t have to do it all at once. Just start by spending more time hanging out with friends, joining clubs, or studying with people. You’ll feel _tired_, but also **clear-minded**.

### 5. Study with Strangers 👥

If you need a little extra push, there are these **study-with-strangers** online groups where you can study alongside others in real time:

- [Study Together](https://www.studytogether.com/)
- [StudyStream](https://www.studystream.live/home)

### 6. Adventure Studying 🌍

Sometimes a **change of scenery** can help. I call it **adventure studying**—whether it’s a café, a park, or somewhere you’ve never studied before. For me, _IHOP_ has become a favorite spot. Try finding a place you like and shake up your routine.

Remember, **it's not a sprint; it's a marathon**. Recovery takes time, but the more you practice being mindful, the stronger your focus will get. Whether you're just starting or already deep into the process, progress is progress. 💪
