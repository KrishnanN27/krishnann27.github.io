### Lyrics

#### Verse
Weight of the world on my shoulders,  
You lift me up and ease my mind.  
Lord, I’m blessed just to know Ya,  
Your Word is written in my life.  

It’s the way that You bring peace,  
It’s the way that You bring peace (oh-oh, oh-oh).  
I know You’ve loved me for all of time,  
And saved my heart, redeemed my life (oh-oh, oh-oh).  

Your grace surrounds me and it gives me life,  
And that’s why night after night,  
I’ll be praising Your light.  

#### Chorus
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,  
Saturday, Sunday (a week).  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,  
Seven days a week.  

Every hour, every minute, every second,  
You know night after night,  
I’ll be praising Your light, seven days a week.  

#### Verse
I’m alive ‘cause You stepped right in,  
All my heart, I’m offering.  
Show the world Your devotion, Lord,  
Deeper than the ocean is.  

Take me close, I’ll never go,  
Fill me with Your Spirit’s glow.  
Show the world Your devotion, Lord,  
Deeper than the ocean is.  

It’s the way that You bring peace,  
It’s the way that You bring peace (oh-oh, oh-oh).  
I know You’ve loved me for all of time,  
And saved my heart, redeemed my life (oh-oh, oh-oh).  

Your grace surrounds me and it gives me life,  
And that’s why night after night,  
I’ll be praising Your light, oh-oh-oh-oh.  

#### Chorus
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,  
Saturday, Sunday (a week).  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,  
Seven days a week.  

Every hour, every minute, every second (oh, oh, oh),  
You know night after night,  
I’ll be praising Your light, seven days a week (yeah).  

#### Outro
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,  
Saturday, Sunday (a week).  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh).  
Seven days a week.  

Every hour, every minute, every second,  
You know night after night,  
I’ll be praising Your light, seven days a week.
